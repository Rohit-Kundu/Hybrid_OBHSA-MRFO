# Hybrid_OBHSA-MRFO

Hybrid of two Wrapper feature selection algorithms- MRFO and OBHSA. Populations are generated from both the methods and the final population from both are stacked and the average ranks calculated to determine importance of features. Top 'k' highest ranked features are used. The hybridization strategy is based on the paper: [A Hybrid Meta-Heuristic Feature Selection Method Using Golden Ratio and Equilibrium Optimization Algorithms for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9247182)
